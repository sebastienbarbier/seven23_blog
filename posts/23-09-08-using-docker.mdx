Seven23 now provides a public Docker image for quickly installing and running both the front-end and backend on your machine ü•≥. 

This is part of our [v1.2.1](https://github.com/sebastienbarbier/seven23/releases/tag/v1.2.1) minor release, which was implemented in response to a [user request](https://github.com/sebastienbarbier/seven23/issues/115). It will make it a lot easier for new users to install and maintain their self-hosted instance.

Our project is divided into two main components:
- A web application available at [app.seven23.io](https://app.seven23.io)
- A server storage system for syncing data between multiple devices.

## Hosting the Web Application

The app is designed to connect to any instance by providing the URL of your server on startup, and it can be used at [app.seven23.io](https://app.seven23.io). If, for some reason, you wish to self-host it, a Docker image [sebastienbarbier/seven23_app](https://hub.docker.com/r/sebastienbarbier/seven23_app) is available.

You can run the following command on your machine to access it using any browser at [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000):

```bash
docker run -p 8000:80 sebastienbarbier/seven23_app
```

## Hosting your own server instance

Docker image for our backend is expected to be the most popular one as it allows to fully use the web application at no cost.

A docker image is available as the docker image [sebastienbarbier/seven23](https://hub.docker.com/r/sebastienbarbier/seven23).

To install locally, you can run:

```bash
docker run -p 8080:80 sebastienbarbier/seven23
```

Full description of how to configure it using environment variables can be found in its [documentation](https://seven23-server.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## As a Developer

Docker images mostly resonate with developers as an easy-to-use solution. They also enable us to improve our internal processes, such as deploying a full backend to test each new version of our application within our Continuous Integration (CI) tool. This is achieved by defining a service within GitHub Actions and describing it within the [.github/workflows/build.yaml](https://github.com/sebastienbarbier/seven23/blob/main/.github/workflows/build.yaml) file:

```yaml
name: "Build and Deploy"
on: [push]
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    services:
      seven23:
        image: sebastienbarbier/seven23
        env:
          ALLOW_ACCOUNT_CREATION: True
        ports:
          - 8000:8000
    steps:
        - ...

```

## What's Next

Our goal is to fully maintain these images and ensure users encounter minimal issues when using them.

If you encounter any bugs or issues, please feel free to create a ticket using our [bug tracker](https://github.com/sebastienbarbier/seven23/issues).
