Seven23 started as a playground to experiment with the latest web technologies, and at the same time to solve a need to track some personal expenses. After using it for more than 6 years and keeping it at a minimum viable product state, time will be invested to make it a full grown product.

Such process will involve more people and so a need for better communication and more visibility. For now we will mostly be using:

- [**Seven23.io homepage**](https://seven23.io) for introduction.
- a new [**blog**](https://blog.seven23.io) to share progress and statements.
- [@seven23_app](https://twitter.com/seven23_app) twitter account for direct feedbacks.

Next step will be to work on a full roadmap to achieve a first stable release. There is currently no deadline, but hopefully more to come soon.
