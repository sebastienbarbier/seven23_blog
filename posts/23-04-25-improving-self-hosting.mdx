We're excited to announce the version 1.2.0 release of our server side, which includes significant improvements to the self-hosting experience. With this release, users can take full control over their data and customize their setup to their specific needs, while also enjoying enhanced security, privacy, and cost savings.

One of the key improvements in this release is the streamlined setup process, which makes it easier than ever to get started with self-hosting. Users can now quickly and easily configure their server and install the application, with step-by-step guidance throughout the process. This eliminates many of the technical hurdles that previously made self-hosting a daunting prospect for many users.

Public Docker image can be found on hub.docker [sebastienbarbier/seven23](https://hub.docker.com/r/sebastienbarbier/seven23). This allows users to install our server instance directly on their machine with just a single command, greatly simplifying the installation process. To install the Docker image, simply run the following command:

```bash
docker run -p 8000:8000 sebastienbarbier/seven23
```

This will pull the latest version of the Docker image and start the application on port 8000. Users can then access the application in their web browser by navigating to [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).

Documentation has been updated accordingly and can be found [here](https://seven23-server.readthedocs.io/en/latest/deployment.html).
